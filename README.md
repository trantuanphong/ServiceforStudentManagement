# ServiceforStudentManagement

  This is the first Java web project of our team which designed base on Model - View - Controller architecture. 

  This system plays a role like an intermediary between service users (students) and service provider, such as: dormitory, clean up, library, food. It allows service user follow services that they register and check up whenever they want. It provides a market, an opportunity for service providers approach guests easier. 
  Specially, “Service for Student Management” can serve different type of service which means different business rules. Service providers can describe the service that they want to provide. Administrator of system will build another system and add to this system
